To Add
- Sound
- Make burning enemy look better
- Make blunt weapons stun loner on crit?
- Assassins go invisible next to walls, and improve AI accordingly
- Smaller dragons in addition
- Monsters should gain HP and damage when they start at higher hitpoints
- Axes shouldn't gain as much DV with levels
- Shields have 1.5(?)x effectiveness when standing still
- Shields have 2(?)x effectiveness when retreated from the attack
- Warload death doesn't look fantastic

Questions
- Should dragons have a winged leap - something that has maybe a 10 turn
  cooldown, and costs a little MP to jump 5 spaces or something?
  	I don't think so
- How should multiple weapons be handled?
	Presently:
		Attack takes as long as slowest weapon
		Both weapons attack at once, with a two weapon skill
	Options:
		Can only wield 1 at a time, or 1 and a dagger
		Can weild multiple weapons, but only attack with one at a time, maybe with 3/4 speed?
		Can wield multiple weapons, but each weapon only takes as long as it takes
- Should critters be scattered as opposed to starting in the same place?
- My original thought with goliaths was to have them
  charge, but I can't think of a good way to make that work
- Should Critters follow more cleverly, or roam? At the moment, they blindly
  move towards the nearest enemy
		
To Refactor
- Seperate the interface from the game as much as possible. This is not done
  nearly at all now
- Move the special tile thing out of tryMove to seperate cell classes
  
Bugs to fix
- Shields can't affect ToHit of weapons when equipped
- map.ChooseItem can't choose the least likely item  (unknown - needs testing)
- Equipping an item to left hand while holding a 2 handed item holds both items
- Some enemies (particularly in a line) seen to disappear (unknown - needs testing)
- Animations display when out of sight
- Flames shoot behind as well 
- Flames animation needs to store previous state and draw it if no fire there anymore
- Orcs won't do any melee at all, and can be easily cornered. They're still fun
  (I think)
- There is some circumstance where moveTo in BUGGYBIT00 in orc.py is [(,)] rather then (,,,).
  I'm not sure why it is. When it is that, it crashes (rightfully so). There is a bandaid
  fix on it at the moment, but it needs to be looked at. There is probably some path of
  execution in which moveTo = moveTo[1] is never triggered. 

Poential changes:
- Check if the run away code (in Bandit.py for instance) could survive getting the maximum value
  to run away rather then the nearest that's at least 5 away
- Bandit AI is slow
- Zombie DV mod is in character.py. I think this is too slow and should be moved.
