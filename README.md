Atlas Warriors
=============

Atlas Warriors is a Roguelike Game primarily developed by Lachlan Kingsford of www.nerdygentleman.com.

You can financially support the development of this project at the moment by pledgie at https://pledgie.com/campaigns/27179 , paypal donation to lachlan@nerdygentleman.com or bitcoin donation to 14PgnsEcgqgSrCFxTjVvczfu5Fyh85hjbU

The game is designed from the outset to be in some ways a minimalist roguelike, taking inspiration from Brogue. Every monster must fight differently and have a unique purpose.

The game is currently about 30 minutes long. I do not want the game to get any longer then that.

Ideally, I'm hoping for a point where a person can beat Easiest within 20 or 30 tries.

It can not be considered finished just yet.

By way of full disclosure, I wish to accept donations for this project and may use it (as permitted by the MIT license) to create a commercial project in the future. I will be creating a Pledgie campaign for it.
